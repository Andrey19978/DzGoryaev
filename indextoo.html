        <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
        <P>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</P>
        <h4 id="two"><a id="one">ax + b = 0 </a></h4>
        <br><br>where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a
        linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may
        not be an x so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an x there.

        <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

        The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
        <br><br>

        <h4 id="two"><a id="one">ax<sup><small>2</small></sup> + bx + c = 0 </a></h4>
        <br><br>
        where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.
        <br><br>
        <h2> The area of a circle (A)</h2>
        <br><br>
        [sign] (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:
        <br><br>

        <h4 id="two"><a id="one">A = &#960;  &#215; r<sup><small>2</small></sup> </a></h4>
        <br><br>
        or, when you know the diameter (D):
        <br><br>
        <h4 id="two"><a id="one">A = (&#960; / 4) &#215; D<sup><small>2</small></sup> </a></h4>
        <br><br>
        or, when you know the circumference (C):
        <br><br>
        <h4 id="two"><a id="one">A = C<sup><small>2</small></sup> / 4   &#215; &#960;</a></h4>
        <br><br>

        <h2> Intersection</h2>

        The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both
        the sets A and B. In symbols,
        <br><br>
        <h4 id="two"><a id="one">A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B } </a></h4>
        <br><br>
        That is, x is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element
        of B.
