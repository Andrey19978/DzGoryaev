PROLOGUE
<br>
Two households, both alike in dignity,
<br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
<br>
From ancient grudge, break to new mutiny,
<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
<br>
5From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
<br>
A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,
<br>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows°
<br>
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
<br>
This fearful showing of their death-marked love,
<br>
And the exhibition of their parents’ rage
<br>
Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove
<br>
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage
<br>
That which–if you with patient ears attend
<br>
Here goes unsaid, our toil shall strive to mend.
<br>
SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
<br>
Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
<br>
SAMPSON
<br>
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
<br>
GREGORY
<br>
No, for then we should be colliers.
