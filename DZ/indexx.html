           ACT 1</h3>
        <br>
<h3>PROLOGUE
<br></h3>
    Two households, both alike in dignity,
    <br>
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    <br>
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    <br>
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    <br>
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    <br>
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    <br>
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
    <br>
    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
    <br>
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    <br>
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    <br>
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
    <br>
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    <br>
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    <br>
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. 
<br>
<h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
<br>
Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
<br>
<h3>SAMPSON</h3>
<br>
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
<br>
<h3>GREGORY</h3>
<br>
No, for then we should be colliers.
